# What's Next

Now that you've completed the tutorial you should have a better understanding of Elm and the Elm Architecture. If not, then please file an issue letting me know what's tripping you up.

The best way to exercise your new found knowledge is to use it. Use it to build a clone of an existing application. Use it to [introduce Elm to your workplace](http://elm-lang.org/blog/how-to-use-elm-at-work). Use it on a personal project. Or, use it to help others learn Elm and reinforce your own understanding.

If you liked the tutorial then please show your support by giving the [dwayne/elm-todos](https://github.com/dwayne/elm-todos) repository a star.

Thanks again and bye for now.
